* black box variational inference with propagators

This library is very experimental and still in development. I made it
available mostly so instructors for the course "[[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/fogm/2019F/index.html][Foundations of
Graphical Models]]" could access the code (this was developed as my
final project for the course).  I do not recommend it to users at this
early stage.  However that said, contributions are welcome, as well as
feedback (I am relatively new to Haskell).

* documentation

The final report for the course is available at
[[file:doc/akm2203-fogm-final-project.tex][doc/akm2203-fogm-final-project.tex]].

Very sparse documentation is available at
http://www.columbia.edu/~akm2203/propagator-bbvi-0.1.0.0/
Filling out the documentation is top of my to do list.

The main entry point is ~Statistics.BBVI~. Importing that should give
you what you need to get started. There are some examples in
~Statistics.BBVI.Examples~.
