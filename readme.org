* black box variational inference with propagators

This library is very experimental and still in development. I made it
available mostly so instructors for the course "[[http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/fogm/2019F/index.html][Foundations of
Graphical Models]]" could access the code (this was developed as my
final project for the course).  I do not recommend it to users at this
early stage.  However that said, contributions are welcome, as well as
feedback (I am relatively new to Haskell).
